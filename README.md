# Estimation-of-Gaussian-Mixture-Process-Noise-in-State-Space-Models
This repository includes a MATLAB implementation which reproduces the results in Fig. 3 of the paper "Gaussian Mixture Process Noise Interence in State-Space Models with Application to Dynamic Estimation of Temporal Response Functions". The code also displays the dynamic TRF estimates using the methods discussed in the paper and computes the RMSE for the estimates different methods. Please just run the file "Main.m" which loads the variables for the simulation and calls the required functions. The number of iterations for the GMSSM method has been reduced to 30 to reduce the running time. To fully reproduce Fig. 3 of the paper, please increase the number of iterations to 200 (total run-time of ~20 mins on a Windows Core i7 PC)
